Thanks to its highly customizable nature, you can write a very efficient HTTP server such as:

Chat server that requires persistent connections and server push technology (e.g. Comet)

Media streaming server that needs to keep the connection open until the whole media is streamed (e.g. 2 hours of video)

File server that allows the uploading of large files without memory pressure (e.g. uploading 1GB per request)

Scalable mash-up client that connects to tens of thousands of 3rd party web services asynchronously
